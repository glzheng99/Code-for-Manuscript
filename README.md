This GAMS code applies SCEQ to solve Baseline model with solar radiation modification tipping risk 
in the Supporting information of Zheng, Liao and Cai et.al (2024)

The codes of two programs are included here, 
where GAMS code provides the baseline model and solves the SCEQ algorithm for solving all possible paths. 
And the MATLAB code provides how to simulate the paths in the paper's figure by the possible paths.


This code is based on
(1) Cai, Y., and K.L. Judd (2023). A Simple but Powerful Simulated Certainty Equivalent
*   Approximation Method for Dynamic Stochastic Problems. Quantitative Economics.
(2) DICE 2023 with 5 year time periods given in the webpage:
